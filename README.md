>Lending Club Case Study
Lending loans to "risky" applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
The objective of yhe study is to identify the risky loan applicants using EDA.

## Conclusions - Univariate analysis
From the univariate analysis, we can make the following observations that there is more possibility of defaulting when:
* When the 'grades' is 'B'
* When the 'sub_grade' is 'B5'
* When the purpose is 'debt_consolidation'
* When the 'home_ownership' is 'RENT'
* When the 'term' is '36 months'
* When the 'revol_util' is between '60-80'
* When the 'loan_amnt' is between '4k-8k'
* When the 'int_rate' is between '11%-14%'
* When the 'installment' is between '150-300'
* When the 'emp_length' is between '10+ years'
* When the 'annual_inc' is between '26k-52k'
* When the 'dti' is between '10-20'
* When the 'open_acc' is between '3-6'
* When the 'addr_state' is 'CA'

## Conclusions - Bivariate analysis
From the bi-variate analysis, we can make the following observations that there is more possibility of defaulting when:
* When the 'annual_inc' is between '60k-70k' purpose is 'home_improvement' or 'house' 
* When the 'annual_inc' is between '60k-70k' and 'grade' is 'F' or 'G'
* When the 'annual_inc' is between '60k-70k' and 'home_ownership' is 'MORTGAGE'
* When the 'annual_inc' is above '60k' and 'revol_util' is between '80-100'
* When the 'purpose' is 'small_business' and 'loan_amnt' is '14k-16k' 
* When the 'purpose' is 'credit_card' and 'dti' is between '14-16' 
* When the 'purpose' is 'vacation' and 'emp_length' is between '6-7 years'
* When the 'purpose' is 'house' and 'inq_last_6mths' is between '1-2' 
* When the 'home_ownership' is 'MORTGAGE' and 'open_acc' is close to '10'
* When the 'loan_amnt' is between '15k-20k' and 'grade' is 'F'
* When the 'addr_state' is 'WY' and 'loan_amnt' is above '15k'
* When the 'addr_state' is 'DC' and 'annual_inc' is between '70-80k'
* When the 'addr_state' is 'WY' and 'inq_last_6mths' is above '2'
